#summary Sets shotgun piercing.
#labels D-Cvar

= Description =

Controls how many aliens shotgun pellets will pierce. Set to 0 to disable.

This cvar will only have an effect if the damage for the shotgun pellets is high enough to kill an alien and still have some damage left AND [asw_shotgun_pierce_chance] is a reasonable value.
