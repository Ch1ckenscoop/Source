#summary Boosts alien spawn height by this much.
#labels D-Cvar,Obsolete

= Description =

Spawns aliens this height above the spawner's origin. This command was to fix drones falling through the floor on cargo bay when spawned rapidly. However, this bug has been for the most part fixed. If you still experience drones glitching through the floors, try raising this cvar.
