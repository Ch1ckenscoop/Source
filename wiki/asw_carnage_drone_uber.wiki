= Description =

Looks for any spawners that are set to spawn uber drones, and multiplies the set max aliens and set total aliens to spawn by this number. It then divides the set time between spawns by this number. This can be controlled with [asw_carnage_min_interval].

NOTE: I have yet to come across a map where uber drones are normally spawned, so I recommend using this command only after using [asw_carnage_randomize_uber].
