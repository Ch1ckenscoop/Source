= Description =

Controls how much health the medical satchel will heal before destroying itself. Base value comes from marine skills, and setting this to a positive or negative number will add or subtract from that value respectively.

Note: If the time limit set int [asw_healgrenade_duration] is reached before this value, the satchel will self-destruct anyway.
