=== Installing Ch1ckensCoop ===

<a href=http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html><img align=center src=tsvn_logo.png /></a>

You will need [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html TortoiseSVN] and [http://media.steampowered.com/installer/steamcmd.zip SteamCMD] to download, TortoiseSVN install, unzip steamcmd.zip and update Ch1ckensCoop. Make sure that you install the version that is appropriate for your OS.

After installing TortoiseSVN and rebooting your computer, create a folder (let's call it AlienSwarmServer) on a drive that has at least 3 GB of free space(for example: 'c:/AlienSwarmServer').

Right click on the folder and select "SVN Checkout". 

Set the URL to [[InstallServer.wiki|http://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn/trunk/server]] and click OK.

After the checkout is complete, click OK again.

Double click steamcmd.exe in the unziped folder, SteamCMD will automatically update and enter you in to a Steam >prompt
  
  * Type 'login yoursteamuserid' at the Steam >prompt. 
  * Input  yoursteampassword  when password has prompted. 

After successfully logged in, it will prompt to input 'steam guard code' which has sent to you by Steam, check your Steam email account to get the code.

Make sure the 'steam guard code' has input correctly, the 'license info...ok' will be prompted.

Type the following two commands at the Steam >prompt:
  
  * force_install_dir c:/AlienSwarmServer/   
  * app_update 635 validate

Make sure downloading 100% completion with "Success! App '635' fully installed."
  
  * If any assertion failed or error found, delete AlienSwarmServer folder and steamcmd folder,
  * create AlienSwarmServer folder and unzip steamcmd.zip again, 
  * restart from the step "Right click on the folder and select 'SVN Checkout'"

  * Type 'quit' to exit Steamcmd.

Right click on the AlienSwarmServer folder and click "TortoiseSVN > Revert..."

Tick the box for "Select all" and click OK.

Unzip city17_as.rar(part1-3) in folder '/AlienSwarmServer/swarm/addons/' 

  * copy city17_as.vpk to '/AlienSwarmServer/swarm/addons/'


Good job! You've installed the Ch1ckensCoop Alien Swarm Server and 
can now run it by double-clicking the "Start Server" batch file in your AlienSwarmServer folder.
