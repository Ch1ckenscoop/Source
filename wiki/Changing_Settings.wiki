It is highly recommended that you do not change the settings in the files "server.cfg" and "hordemode.cfg". If you edit the server.cfg file, it will be overwritten with the next update. 

It is instead recommended that you create your own file "customsettings.cfg", where you can place any settings you like. This file is automatically exec'd after the server.cfg, so any settings you place in this file will not be overwritten by server.cfg.
